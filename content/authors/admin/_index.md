#### Who We Are
The Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health has established an Advisory Council in partnership with youth residing in Northern Manhattan and the Bronx.

The Environmental Health and Justice (EHJ) Advocates are a group of young leaders committed to reducing disparities and promoting the health of their communities. 

EHJ Advocates will design their own tools for a messaging campaign and incorporate some of the Centerâ€™s latest and cutting-edge research into their messaging and projects.

#### Our Mission
It is our hope that participation in this youth-led council will foster interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields.

We strive to provide opportunities to further knowledge and involvement in public health. 

We are committed to engaging the community to further environmental health and justice and to reduce disparities by promoting community informed: outreach, educational resources, research, and policy development.
